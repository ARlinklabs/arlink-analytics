# arlink-analytics

ARlink Analytics is a React component wrapper that provides easy integration with ARlink analytics for your web application. It automatically tracks page visits and sends analytics data to the AO network.

## Installation

You can install arlink-analytics using npm, yarn, or bun:

```bash
npm install arlink-analytics
# or
yarn add arlink-analytics
# or
bun add arlink-analytics
```

## Usage

To use arlink-analytics in your React project, follow these steps:

1. Import the `AnalyticsWrapper` component in your main App file:

```javascript
import AnalyticsWrapper from 'arlink-analytics';
```

2. Wrap your routes with the `AnalyticsWrapper` component and pass the `processId`:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import AnalyticsWrapper from 'arlink-analytics';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <AnalyticsWrapper processId="your-process-id-here">
        <Routes>
          {/* Your routes here */}
        </Routes>
      </AnalyticsWrapper>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

Replace `"your-process-id-here"` with the process ID generated by ARlink or ARlink analytics viewer.
